# Melbourne-Public-Transport-Accessibility
This project presents a comprehensive spatial analysis of public transport accessibility in Melbourne City, comparing weekday vs. weekend coverage across residential, industrial, and commercial zones. Designed to support equitable transit planning. It integrates geospatial analytics, SQL-based data engineering, and GIS visual storytelling to uncover patterns in transport density, accessibility gaps, and zone-level service availability. It assesses transit accessibility and identify underserved zones in Melbourne City by analyzing GTFS transport data and spatial boundary datasets using advanced SQL, PostGIS, and QGIS techniques.

# Impact of the project
This project goes beyond academic analysis to demonstrate practical, real-world value. It showcases critical capabilities for involving urban infrastructure, geospatial intelligence, or public services optimization.

## Real-world problem solving
Tackles a relevant civic challenge—public transport equity—by transforming open government datasets into meaningful insights for city planning.

## End-to-end data pipeline execution
Demonstrates the complete analytics lifecycle involving data acquisition, preprocessing, spatial transformation, aggregation, to insight communication.

## Spatial and geographic intelligence 
Applies advanced PostGIS operations and GIS visualizations to reveal zone-based disparities and service accessibility patterns.

## Analytical depth with SQL
Showcases the use of modular, multi-stage SQL queries to filter, classify, calculate, and segment large datasets based on time and location.

## Effective data storytelling
Converts raw geospatial data into clear, stakeholder-friendly visuals using QGIS—critical for non-technical decision-making.

## Toolchain versatility: 
Combines database management (PostgreSQL), geospatial tools (PostGIS, QGIS), and SQL proficiency, reflecting adaptability across modern analytics stacks.
