# Migration-Analysis: Visualizing Global Migration Trends
An Interactive Data Storytelling dashboard on Global Border Crossings and Migrant Fatalities Developed using R, Shiny, Leaflet, Plotly, and Dygraphs. This dashboard moves beyond static reports to offer real-time, explorable evidence on one of the world’s most pressing humanitarian crises.

## Impact of the project

**Geographic Insights**: Identified regional hotspots of migrant deaths using interactive mapping.

**Trend Forecasting**: Revealed seasonal peaks in fatalities through time-series prediction.

**Demographic Insights**: Pinpointed vulnerable migrant groups to inform targeted interventions.

**Visual Correlation**: Mapped links between causes of death and routes using a chord diagram for risk mitigation planning.

**Stakeholder Value**: Designed for policymakers, humanitarian agencies, and research institutions aiming to improve migration response strategies.

This project addresses the humanitarian and geopolitical challenges of global migration by creating a dynamic, interactive dashboard that visualizes:

1. Global migrant fatalities over time and geography
2. US–Mexico border encounter trends
3. Demographics and nationality breakdowns
4. Relationships between migration routes and causes of death

The goal is to provide actionable insights to humanitarian organizations, policymakers, and researchers through intuitive and data-rich visualizations.

## Interactive Narrative Dashboard (Built in R, Shiny and D3 framework)

**Dead and Missing Migrants Tab**: Choropleth and bubble maps display fatality counts by region. Clicking reveals time trends via interactive modals.

**US–Mexico Border Tab**: Choropleth and bar charts illustrate encounter trends by state, citizenship, and demographics.

**Detailed Analysis Tab**: A custom chord diagram visualizes links between causes of death and migration routes.
