# Data Analytics Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio of data analytics projects, where I showcase practical, end-to-end solutions across diverse domains‚Äîfrom migration and transport planning to fraud detection and real-time streaming systems.

Each project reflects my commitment to solving real-world problems through data, combining **technical depth**, **business relevance**, and **visual storytelling** using tools like **Python**, **R**, **Spark**, **SQL**, and **Shiny**.

## Projects Included

### 1. üõ°Ô∏è Real-Time eCommerce Fraud Detection (PySpark + Kafka + ML)
A streaming pipeline to detect fraudulent transactions using PySpark MLlib, Kafka producers/consumers, and real-time dashboards.
- Includes historical analysis, model training, clustering, and fraud alerting.
- Stack: PySpark, Kafka, MLlib, Structured Streaming, Docker

### 2. üöä Melbourne Public Transport Accessibility (PostGIS + QGIS + SQL)
A spatial data project analyzing public transport stop density and accessibility across residential, commercial, and industrial zones.
- Informs transit equity and service expansion.
- Stack: PostgreSQL, PostGIS, QGIS, SQL

### 3. üåç Migration Analysis Dashboard (R Shiny + Leaflet + Plotly + Tableau/PowerBI)
An interactive dashboard visualizing global migrant fatalities and US‚ÄìMexico border encounters using time series, maps, and chord diagrams.
- Highlights regional risks, demographic patterns, and forecasting.
- Stack: R, Shiny, Leaflet, Plotly, Prophet, Circlize
